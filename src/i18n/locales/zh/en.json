This aligns with the traditional logic: when the dollar strengthens, gold (priced in dollars) becomes more expensive, suppressing demand and putting pressure on prices; when the dollar weakens, gold becomes more attractive, often leading to price increases. This inverse relationship reflects the unique dynamic between the dollar as a global reserve currency and gold as a store of value, especially during shifts in global capital flows and risk sentiment.",

This low correlation stems from their fundamentally different asset characteristics and drivers. Gold, as a safe-haven asset, is mainly influenced by real interest rates, inflation expectations, and risk aversion, resulting in relatively low volatility. In contrast, global equities are high-risk assets with higher volatility, driven by market sentiment, technological developments, and regulatory policies. Additionally, gold attracts risk-averse and conservative investors seeking diversification, while equities attract risk-tolerant and speculative capital. These differing investor profiles and driving mechanisms further reinforce their independence, resulting in low correlation. Overall, this low correlation highlights gold’s role as a safe-haven asset, contrasting sharply with the risk nature of global equities.",

Its demand is closely tied to economic conditions and consumer purchasing power—higher during economic growth periods and lower during downturns. Technology represents inelastic demand, with a small but stable share, aligning with the tech industry's application needs for gold. Investment is the most volatile component of gold supply. The data shows significant peaks in investment demand around 2013 and 2020, closely related to global economic conditions and market risk sentiment. For instance, the slow global economic recovery in 2013 drove investors toward gold as a safe haven, while in 2020, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused another substantial rise in safe-haven demand, making investment demand the primary component of gold supply.
